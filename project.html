											when the COVID-19 virus began to spread around the world. 
											Many dealt with problems such as shutting down businesses, isolated from family/friends, and loss of loved ones. 
											However, that trip cancellation like many others meant a huge decline in business for the people in the tourist 
											industry which makes up 10% of the global gdp, worth around 9 trillion dollars. Let's find out how much of a toll COVID had on tourism  around the world, 
											which countries' tourism were effected the most, and by how much?</h3>

									<h2>Quarantine = No Business</h2>
								</header>
								<h3>	Starting in the Hubei Province of China, majority of all the countries in the world began implementing preventive measures 
									in late March / early April of 2020. For most countries the severity of the measures depended on 
									the control and containment of COVID-19 infected individuals. Besides lockdowns and closing of businesses, 
									countries also prioritzed the control on international travel.
								</h3>
								<!---<h3>
									Like many others, my family and I stayed at home, 
									rarely going out starting since the first lockdown in San Francisco on March 13, 2020.
									But because lockdowns and closing of businesses was only maintained for short periods at a time, 
									the number of infected and Covid related deaths kept coming back in waves, at least in California, 
									pushing back the full reopening of San Francisco to June 2021.

								<h3>Besides a potentially fatal virus, quaranting upon arrival was a huge factor in the decline of international travel. 
									At the peak of COVID infections and deaths and even up to the end of 2021, quarantining was around 5 to 14 days long,
									 and travelers weren't willing to spend a majority or their entirety of their vacation time in a hotel room. </h3>
